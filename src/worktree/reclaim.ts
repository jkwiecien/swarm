/**
 * The single worktree-reclamation gate (issue #367).
 *
 * Before a new phase treats an existing `task-<id>` checkout as a blocking
 * collision — or a background retention sweep prunes one — SWARM must decide
 * whether that checkout is *safe* to discard. It is safe only when nothing else
 * depends on it: it is not leased by a live run, not pinned by a resumable
 * deferred/failed run, has no uncommitted changes, and has no local commits that
 * were never pushed. Every one of those checks **fails closed** (an error, or an
 * un-resolvable state, counts as "protected"), so an uncertain gate preserves
 * work rather than risking its loss.
 *
 * Both the provision-time collision path (`GitWorktreeManager.provision`) and the
 * retention sweep (`pruneStaleWorktrees`) run through {@link evaluateWorktreeReclaim}
 * so the ordered checks — and the reasons they surface — stay identical.
