/**
 * Provider-neutral merge capability (issue #253; direct-merge-only per issue
 * #292). The adapter performs the provider's *direct* PR/MR merge operation
 * under the project's implementer credential — never the provider's own merge
 * automation (GitHub's native auto-merge is unavailable on many private
 * repositories and has no portable equivalent in Bitbucket/GitLab, so SWARM
 * neither requests nor relies on it). Orchestration — when to ask, how to
 * retry a transient refusal — lives in the durable merge dispatch
 * (`src/worker/merge-automation.ts`), which re-invokes this capability with
 * the approved head SHA on every attempt.
 *
 * Mirrors `src/scm/delivery.ts`'s `ScmDeliveryProvider` seam: dispatch/worker
 * code depends on {@link ScmMergeProvider} only, never on a provider's own
 * client or vocabulary ("pull request" here, not GitHub's `pulls.merge` or
 * GitLab's "merge request"). GitHub is the only implementation today
 * (`GitHubSCMIntegration.mergePullRequest`,
 * `src/integrations/scm/github/scm-integration.ts`). A Bitbucket/GitLab
 * adapter implements the same interface — re-read current PR/MR state, verify
 * the approved head and approval still hold, call its native direct merge
 * endpoint, and map the response onto {@link MergePullRequestOutcome} — with
 * no dispatch or worker changes.

/**
 * Terminal outcome of one merge attempt. Every non-`merged` status is a
 * normal, visible refusal — never a thrown error — so a merge attempt can
 * never retroactively fail an already-submitted, completed Review.
 *
 * - `merged` — the request is merged now, or was already merged (a retry
 *   after a prior success is idempotent).
 * - `not-ready` — a transient readiness condition blocks merging right now:
 *   unsatisfied/pending required checks, unresolved conflicts, or the
 *   provider still converging on required-review state right after a
 *   submission. Expected to clear on its own; the merge dispatch retries it
 *   on a bounded schedule.
 * - `not-eligible` — the approval this attempt was requested for no longer
 *   holds: the head moved (new commits pushed since the review), the PR was
 *   closed or converted back to a draft, or the approving review was
 *   overridden (changes requested since). Distinct from `not-ready`: this
 *   will not clear on its own — it needs a fresh review before merge
 *   automation can proceed again.
 * - `policy-blocked` — a repository policy (branch protection, a ruleset, a
 *   permission restriction) refuses the merge outright; it will not clear on
 *   its own and needs a human to change the policy or merge manually.
 * - `unsupported` — this adapter has no way to perform the requested merge —
 *   a repository configuration this adapter doesn't implement (e.g. a
 *   required merge queue), or a provider that hasn't implemented the
 *   capability at all.
 * - `provider-error` — an unexpected API, authentication, rate-limit, or
 *   transport failure. Distinct from every refusal above: it reflects the
 *   provider being unreachable/misbehaving, not the request's own readiness
 *   or a deliberate policy.
