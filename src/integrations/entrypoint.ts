/**
 * Single canonical registration entrypoint for every SWARM integration.
 *
 * Every runtime surface that needs providers registered (the router today; the
 * worker once SWARM-17 builds it) imports this file as a side-effect module. The
 * imports below trigger each provider's module-load registration into
 * `pmProviderRegistry`.
 *
 * Why one file: Cascade collapsed per-surface barrel lists to a single
 * entrypoint after four production bugs from a provider registered on one
 * surface but not another (see Cascade's `src/integrations/entrypoint.ts`).
 * SWARM adopts the same shape up front so adding a provider is one import here
 * plus its own folder — never an edit to dispatch/orchestration code
 * (ai/CODING_STANDARDS.md "Module shape for a provider").
 *
 * With exactly one PM provider today, this imports the provider index directly.
 * A `src/integrations/pm/index.ts` barrel (mirroring Cascade's) gets introduced
 * when a second PM provider lands, at which point this file imports the barrel
 * instead of each provider.

/**
 * Explicit no-op for call sites that want registration to be visible rather than
 * relying on the bare import side effect. In production, importing this module is
 * already enough — the `import` above has done the work by the time this is
