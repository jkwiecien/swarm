/**
 * PMProviderManifest — the single declarative contract describing a PM provider
 * end-to-end, so a provider registers itself in one place and shared code looks
 * it up by `id` instead of branching on a concrete provider
 * (ai/CODING_STANDARDS.md "Module shape for a provider").
 *
 * Mirrors Cascade's `src/integrations/pm/manifest.ts`, but **scoped down to
 * SWARM's MVP** — the same trimming `src/pm/types.ts` did to Cascade's
 * `PMProvider`. Cascade's manifest carries ~15 fields because it ships three
 * providers plus a wizard/discovery/tRPC layer; SWARM has exactly one provider
 * (GitHub Projects) and only the pieces below exist today. The rest are left out
 * until the phase that needs them, so the manifest doesn't advertise a contract
 * nothing implements:
 *
 * - `credentialRoles` / `webhookRoute` / `verifyWebhookSignature` — SWARM's
 *   GitHub Projects and SCM subscriptions share one `/github/webhook` route and
 *   one HMAC secret (`src/router/webhook-receiver.ts`,
 *   docs/github-projects-v2-api.md §5), so there's no per-provider route or
 *   signature scheme to declare, and credentials are a fixed
 *   implementer/reviewer/webhookSecret triple (`src/config/schema.ts`), not a
 *   provider-specific role list.
 * - `triggerHandlers`, `platformClientFactory`, `extractProjectIdFromJob`. The
 *   concrete `PMProvider` (`github-projects/provider.ts`) is exposed through
 *   the manifest's `createProvider` factory for provider-agnostic reads; the
 *   trigger handlers (`src/triggers/handlers/`) remain in the trigger registry.
 *   The remaining fields get added the day a second provider makes the
 *   registry lookup earn its keep, not before.
 * - wizard / lifecycle-conformance fields — SWARM has no setup wizard, and the
 *   conformance harness is explicitly deferred until there's a second provider
 *   (ai/TESTING.md "Provider conformance"). Discovery, by contrast, is no longer
 *   deferred: the board-mapping screen (issue #201) is a real consumer, so the
 *   manifest declares each provider's `discovery` capabilities below.
 *
 * `routerAdapter` is typed to the concrete `GitHubProjectsRouterAdapter` because
 * there's one provider: a shared `PMRouterAdapter` interface would be
 * speculative today (ai/TESTING.md "don't build it speculatively"). It gets
 * extracted the moment a second PM provider lands — the same point a `pm/index.ts`
 * barrel and the conformance harness arrive.
