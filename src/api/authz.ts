/**
 * Project-scoped **authorization** for the tRPC API (#281 task 4) — the
 * enforcement layer that finally consumes the identity context (task 2) and the
 * membership read model (task 3). Where `authedProcedure` (`./trpc.ts`) answers
 * *"is there a signed-in user?"*, these helpers answer *"may this user touch
 * this project, at this level?"* — the second of ADR-001's three authorization
 * layers (installation role → project membership → worker enrollment;
 * `docs/decisions/ADR-001-federated-workers-and-project-access.md`).
 *
 * The role → capability matrix, defined here once and referenced by every
 * project-scoped procedure (`routers/projects.ts`, `routers/runs.ts`, the nested
 * `routers/credentials.ts`):
 *
 * | Capability                                   | Min role      | Predicate            |
 * | -------------------------------------------- | ------------- | -------------------- |
 * | Read a project / its runs / its credentials  | `contributor` | `canReadProject`     |
 * | Drive a project's runs (retry/terminate/…)   | `member`      | `canWriteProject`    |
 * | Administer config / credentials / delete     | `projectAdmin`| `canAdministerProject`|
 *
 * An `instanceAdmin` (installation role, layer 1) bypasses every check and
 * accesses every project. A user with *no* membership cannot even learn a
 * project exists — reads and mutations alike surface `NOT_FOUND`, not
 * `FORBIDDEN`, so the API never leaks which project ids are real. A member whose
 * role is below the required level gets `FORBIDDEN` (they already know the
 * project exists). The three named roles and their ordering are the source of
 * truth in `../identity/membership.ts`; this module only maps procedures onto
 * them.
