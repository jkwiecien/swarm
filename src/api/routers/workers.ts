/**
 * The tRPC **workers** router (#337 Phase 3) — the enrollment-side companion to
 * `routers/projects.ts`. It exposes three clearly separated surfaces, all gated
 * by the identity/authorization layers ADR-001 establishes:
 *
 * - **Installation roster** (`list`, #133): the read-only cross-project
 *   connectivity view the dashboard's Workers screen renders, bounded by
 *   `accessibleProjectScope` — an `instanceAdmin` sees every registered worker,
 *   anyone else only workers enrolled in projects they may access.
 * - **Owner self-service**, scoped to `ctx.user`: an owner lists *their own*
 *   workers and enrollments (`listMine`), offers a worker to a project
 *   (`enroll`), and controls the revocable sharing consent (`setConsent`) and
 *   execution constraints (`updateConstraints`). Ownership is checked per call;
 *   a caller who does not own the worker (and is not an `instanceAdmin`) gets
 *   `NOT_FOUND`, so worker/enrollment existence never leaks across owners.
 * - **Project roster**, gated by `assertProjectAccess` exactly like
 *   `routers/projects.ts`: a `contributor` reads the roster (`roster`); only a
 *   `projectAdmin` approves an enrollment (`approveEnrollment`) or revokes/
 *   reactivates one (`setStatus`). A non-member gets `NOT_FOUND` (existence
 *   hidden), a member below the required role `FORBIDDEN`.
 *
 * Read models here expose **no secrets** (the service assembles secret-free
 * views) and derive busy/current-run from run lifecycle, never from the client.
 * None of this dispatches work: revoking consent/enrollment only flips the
 * `isRoutable` predicate the #130 gate consumes — it never terminates a running
 * agent (out of scope).
