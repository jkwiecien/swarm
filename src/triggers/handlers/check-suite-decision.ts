/**
 * The aggregate-check-state decision for the `pr-review` handler
 * (`src/triggers/handlers/review.ts`), ported from Cascade's
 * `check-suite-decision.ts`.
 *
 * GitHub fires one `check_suite.completed` per workflow, so no single event
 * knows whether CI as a whole is done. Given the aggregate state of *every*
 * check on the head SHA (`getCheckSuiteStatus`), this decides the one thing the
 * handler needs: review now (all passed), respond-to-ci (a check failed), or
 * defer and re-check later (some check still running). It is a pure function of
 * the aggregate — the author/draft/fork gates live in the handler — so it
 * unit-tests without any GitHub or queue plumbing.

/**
 * Decide what to do with a PR's aggregate CI state:
 *
 *  - `defer`  — some check hasn't reached `completed`. The caller schedules a
 *    coalesced re-check so a stale Actions API (which can lag the webhook that
 *    woke us) is re-queried rather than trusted once.
 *  - `respond-to-ci` — every check completed and at least one failed. Routes
 *    the PR to the Respond-to-CI phase (`src/pipeline/respond-to-ci.ts`), which
 *    runs the implementer to fix the build — mirroring Cascade's respond-to-ci
 *    agent. `failedChecks` names the failing runs for the handler's log line.
 *  - `review` — every check completed and none failed. A zero-check result
 *    defers under the default `required` policy: the Actions API can
 *    temporarily return no runs just after a new commit, and treating that as
 *    green would bypass CI. Projects with no CI at all opt into `if-present`
 *    (`pipeline.review.checks`, `src/config/schema.ts`), where a zero-check
 *    result reviews immediately instead — see the `policy` parameter (issue #274).
