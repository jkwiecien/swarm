/**
 * `pr-review` trigger — the PR-lifecycle handler. It starts the Review phase
 * (`src/pipeline/review.ts`) when a PR is opened or its checks pass, and routes
 * a *failing* check suite to the Respond-to-CI phase (`src/pipeline/respond-to-ci.ts`),
 * mirroring Cascade's review-agent + respond-to-ci triggers on `check_suite`
 * completion (ai/ARCHITECTURE.md "Pipeline phases" #3 / respond-to-ci).
 *
 * Two entry events, one handler:
 *  - `pull_request` `opened` (non-draft) — review the freshly opened PR.
 *  - `check_suite` `completed` — review the commit CI just validated (why the
 *    phase pins its checkout to the head SHA), or fix it if CI failed.
 *
 * **The `opened` dispatch races the Implementation phase's own wrap-up — by
 * design.** The implementer opens the PR (`gh pr create`) as one of its last
 * actions *inside* its still-running agent process, so GitHub delivers
 * `pull_request opened` — and this handler dispatches Review — a few seconds
 * before the Implementation phase logs its own `Phase finished` and moves the
 * board. In an interleaved worker log (`SWARM_WORKER_CONCURRENCY > 1`) that reads
 * as "Review started before Implementation finished", which looks like an
 * out-of-order pipeline but isn't: Review provisions its *own* detached worktree
 * at the head SHA and touches nothing the implementer owns, and if the implementer
 * pushes further commits after opening the PR, their `check_suite` re-enters here
 * and re-reviews at the final SHA (the PR+SHA dedup keys on the new commit, so the
 * later review isn't dropped). No serialization needed; the per-run `logContext`
 * (`taskId`/`phase` on every `agent run finished` line) is what disambiguates the
 * interleave.
 *
 * **Aggregate check state, not this suite's conclusion.** GitHub fires one
 * `check_suite.completed` per workflow, so any single event's own `conclusion`
 * describes only its suite while siblings may still be running. On a
 * `check_suite` event the handler re-queries *every* check on the head SHA
 * (`getCheckSuiteStatus`) and decides via `decideCheckSuiteOutcome`
 * (`check-suite-decision.ts`): review if all complete and none failed,
 * respond-to-ci if a check failed, or **defer** if some check is still
 * incomplete. Ported from Cascade's `check-suite-success`/`-failure` triggers.
 *
 * **Respond-to-CI loop guard.** Fixing a build pushes a commit → a new head SHA
 * → a fresh `check_suite`, so if the fix doesn't stick the same PR routes back
 * here. The PR+SHA dedup can't stop that (each attempt is a new SHA), so
 * `dispatchRespondToCi` adds a per-PR fix-attempt cap (`respond-to-ci-attempts.ts`)
 * that winds a never-sticking fix down to a warn-and-drop, mirroring Cascade's
 * `MAX_ATTEMPTS`.
 *
 * **Deferred recheck.** A defer schedules a coalesced re-enqueue of this same
 * event ~30s out (`scheduleCoalescedJob`). This guards the case where the
 * Actions API lags webhook delivery — the suite reports complete over the
 * webhook, but a query moments later still shows it `in_progress`, and no
 * further webhook will arrive to wake us. The recheck re-queries fresh API
 * state; `recheckAttempt` caps the loop so a permanently-stale API can't
 * reschedule forever (a genuinely slow CI run is re-triggered by its own later
 * `check_suite` webhook, so the cap can't drop a legitimate review). A *failed*
 * aggregate query (transient Actions-API error, or an unresolvable reviewer
 * token) degrades to the same bounded recheck rather than throwing out of the
 * handler and burning the job's retries — see `resolveCheckSuiteReview`.
 *
 * **Same-repo gate.** Fork PRs are dropped (`pull_request` events, via
 * `isCrossRepo`): the Review phase's `provision` fetches only the base repo's
 * refs, so a fork's head SHA is unreachable and the detached checkout would
 * fail the job (see `src/pipeline/review.ts`'s header). A `check_suite` payload
 * doesn't reliably tell us fork-ness, so that path can't pre-filter forks — an
 * unreachable SHA there surfaces as a failed job rather than a silent drop.
 *
 * **Author-persona gate.** SWARM reviews only PRs authored by one of its own
 * personas (the implementer opens every SWARM PR), mirroring Cascade's
 * `decideCheckSuiteGates` in its default `authorMode='own'` mode: a human- or
 * third-party-bot-authored PR completing its checks (or being opened) must not
 * burn a review. On the `pull_request` path the author rides in the payload
 * (`prAuthorLogin`), so the gate is free; on the `check_suite` path the payload
 * carries no author, so it costs one `pulls.get` — run *before* the aggregate
 * query so a PR we'd never review doesn't also pay for the (heavier) Actions-API
 * call. The configurable own/external/all knob and base-branch gate Cascade
 * exposes are out of scope — see `isSwarmAuthoredPr`.
 *
 * **Cross-process dedup.** A PR that opens *and* then passes checks (or a PR
 * with several check suites) would otherwise dispatch Review more than once for
 * the same head SHA, each burning agent tokens. `handle` claims a Redis-backed
 * slot keyed on the PR+SHA (`review-dispatch-dedup.ts`) before returning a
 * dispatch; a duplicate claim short-circuits to a skip. The claim happens here,
 * at the single dispatch-decision point, so the duplicate is dropped before any
 * worktree is provisioned.
