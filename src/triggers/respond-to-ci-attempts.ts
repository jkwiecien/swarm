/**
 * Respond-to-CI fix-attempt cap, Redis-backed — the loop guard the per-SHA
 * review dedup (`review-dispatch-dedup.ts`) can't provide.
 *
 * The Respond-to-CI phase fixes a failing build by pushing a commit. That new
 * commit is a *new* head SHA, so it fires a fresh `check_suite` — and if the
 * fix didn't actually make CI green, the review handler routes it straight back
 * to Respond-to-CI. The PR+SHA dedup can't stop that: each attempt is a
 * different SHA, so every one claims a fresh slot. Left unbounded, a fix that
 * never sticks loops forever, burning an agent run each round. (Loop-prevention
 * doesn't catch it either — `check_suite` events are deliberately never dropped
 * as self-authored, since the persona pushing the fix isn't the suite's sender.)
 *
 * So this caps *distinct fix attempts per PR*. `claimRespondToCiAttempt` bumps a
 * per-PR counter (`INCR`, with a TTL refreshed each bump) and returns whether
 * the PR is still under {@link MAX_FIX_ATTEMPTS}. The counter is keyed on the PR,
 * not the SHA, so it accumulates across fix commits; the TTL lets a PR that goes
 * quiet reset so genuinely new work later can be fixed again.
 *
 * Redis (not a process-local Map) for the same reason as the dedup: sibling
 * events for one PR become distinct BullMQ jobs that may run on different worker
 * replicas with no shared memory. Mirrors `review-dispatch-dedup.ts`.
 *
 * **Fails open**, unlike the dedup. If Redis is unreachable the attempt is
 * *allowed* (logged) rather than blocked: a transient blip must not disable
 * CI-fix wholesale, and the per-SHA dedup — which fails closed — still stops
 * duplicate agents for the same commit. The bounded downside is a few extra
 * attempts during an outage, versus silently dropping every legitimate fix.
