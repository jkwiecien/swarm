 * ingress (ai/ARCHITECTURE.md "PM: GitHub Projects").
 *
 * Its job: parse the raw webhook into a normalized event, resolve which SWARM
 * project owns the *board* (by `project_node_id` — a Projects event carries no
 * repo, unlike the SCM adapter which resolves by `owner/repo`), filter to the
 * transitions the pipeline reacts to (a Status-field edit, or a card added to
 * the board), and drop transitions a SWARM persona itself produced (loop
 * prevention). The authoritative "which Status option is it now?" re-read and
 * the option → pipeline-phase dispatch live downstream (the GraphQL client /
 * worker, separate Phase-2 issues) — this adapter is the doorbell, per
 * docs/github-projects-v2-api.md §5: it never trusts a Status value lifted from
