/**
 * GitHubRouterAdapter — the router-side GitHub logic, ported (and trimmed to
 * SWARM's MVP) from Cascade's `src/router/adapters/github.ts`.
 *
 * Its job for the four inbound event types (`pull_request`,
 * `pull_request_review`, `issue_comment`, `check_suite`) is: parse the raw
 * webhook into a normalized event, resolve which SWARM project owns the repo,
 * decide whether the event was one SWARM produced itself (loop prevention), and
 * run a handler under the right persona's credentials. The actual trigger →
 * agent-type routing that decides *what* to do with an event lands with the
 * trigger registry (a later phase); this adapter owns everything up to and
 * including "which persona acts, and never on our own output".
