/**
 * Enqueue seam — the boundary between the webhook receiver and the dispatch
 * layer.
 *
 * The receiver's job (SWARM-9) ends once an event has been authenticated,
 * matched to a project, and cleared by loop prevention; at that point it hands
 * the normalized event here. Since issue #284 (ADR-002) this creates a durable
 * dispatch record and publishes its wake-up (`src/dispatch/dispatcher.ts`)
 * rather than writing business state into BullMQ: the delivery id becomes the
 * dispatch's permanent dedup identity, so a redelivered webhook can never mint
 * a second dispatch. The trigger decision is not embedded here — the worker
 * runs the trigger registry against the parsed event after claiming the
 * dispatch.
 *
 * The router does not run DB migrations; if the dispatch table is unavailable
 * (a mid-deploy window), the event falls back to a legacy dispatch-less queue
 * job, which the worker adopts into the durable model at dequeue — a webhook is
 * never dropped because the dispatch layer was mid-deploy.
