/**
 * Provider-neutral **worker-session** surface — the seam the in-process MVP
 * worker (and, later, the #130 dispatch gate) programs against so it never
 * touches the `worker_sessions` table directly. The lease/heartbeat companion to
 * the worker identity service (`./worker-service.ts`), Phase 2 of the worker
 * slice (ADR-001 "User / worker").
 *
 * Every mutating operation **authenticates the worker by its Phase-1 credential**
 * first (`resolveWorkerByCredential`): an unknown/empty credential is an auth
 * failure, so it throws {@link UnknownWorkerCredentialError} rather than silently
 * no-op'ing. `validateFencingToken` and `getLiveSessionForWorker` are the
 * read-side seams a server-side caller (which already knows the worker id) uses —
 * `#130` calls `validateFencingToken` before it dispatches/advances a run to
 * reject a stale/replaced worker.
 *
 * The heartbeat TTL is read from `SWARM_WORKER_HEARTBEAT_TTL_MS` (default
 * {@link DEFAULT_WORKER_HEARTBEAT_TTL_MS}) and validated as a positive integer,
 * mirroring the sibling worker knobs (`src/worker/runtime-options.ts`); it is
 * resolved once per call and threaded down, and overridable per call so tests can
 * drive expiry deterministically. There is no daemon/network transport here — the
 * MVP worker is in-process, so these are plain in-process service calls.
