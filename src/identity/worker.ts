/**
 * The registered **worker** identity — the single source of truth for the shape
 * (ai/CODING_STANDARDS.md "Zod is the source of truth"). A worker is a *locally
 * operated execution environment* owned by a SWARM user (ADR-001 "User /
 * worker"): the machine on which that user runs agent CLIs. Where `SwarmUser`
 * (`./schema.ts`) models *who* a person is and `ProjectMembership`
 * (`./membership.ts`) models *what* they may do on a project, a worker models
 * *where* a user can execute — the third-layer identity of the multi-user
 * foundation.
 *
 * It is deliberately **provider-neutral**: a worker is **not** an SCM identity
 * and **not** an implementer/reviewer GitHub credential (those stay in
 * `project_credentials`, per persona per project). Its declared CLI capabilities
 * are the harness vocabulary (`AgentCliSchema`, `../harness/agent-cli.ts`), not a
 * parallel enum.
 *
 * A worker carries its own authentication material — the **worker credential**,
 * issued once at registration and distinct from any SCM PAT. That secret is
 * deliberately **absent from this read model**, exactly as `users.password_hash`
 * is dropped from `SwarmUser`: only a SHA-256 of the credential is persisted (on
 * `workers.credential_hash`), the raw credential is returned exactly once at
 * registration, and nothing here ever exposes either form (see
 * `./worker-service.ts`, mirroring `createSession`/`MintedSession` in
 * `./auth.ts`).
 *
 * Worker sessions, project enrollment, and the eligibility gate consume this
 * identity when selecting and claiming an execution host.
