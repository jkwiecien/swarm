/**
 * Provider-neutral **worker-enrollment** surface — the seam the tRPC `workers`
 * router, the `swarm workers` CLI, and (later) the #130 dispatch gate program
 * against so they never touch the `worker_project_enrollments` table directly.
 * Phase 3 of the worker slice, on top of Phase 1's identity
 * (`./worker-service.ts`) and Phase 2's sessions (`./worker-session-service.ts`),
 * and the enrollment-side companion to the membership read model
 * (`./membership-service.ts`).
 *
 * It owns both the enrollment write operations (`enrollWorker` /
 * `approveEnrollment` / `setSharingConsent` / `updateEnrollmentConstraints` /
 * `setEnrollmentStatus`) and the two provider-neutral read models:
 *
 * - `listProjectRoster(projectId)` — every worker enrolled in a project, with
 *   display name, owner, capabilities, status, allowed CLIs, concurrency,
 *   sharing consent, the derived {@link isRoutable} verdict, and derived
 *   busy/current-run state.
 * - `listOwnerWorkers(ownerUserId)` — an owner's self-service view of their own
 *   workers and each worker's enrollments across projects.
 * - `listDashboardWorkers(projectScope)` — the cross-project connectivity roster
 *   the dashboard's Workers screen renders (#133), scoped to what the viewer may
 *   see.
 * - `listProjectDispatchCandidates(projectId)` — the same project scope in the
 *   shape the #130 dispatch gate judges (`src/worker/eligibility-gate.ts`):
 *   worker + enrollment + resolved availability, in the deterministic
 *   enrollment-creation order the scheduler selects by.
 *
 * **No secrets** leave this surface. The assembled views are built by explicitly
 * naming the safe fields (never spreading a row), so a repo path, PAT, local
 * CLI token, or credential hash can never ride along — the `Worker` read model
 * already omits the credential hash, and this layer never reaches for project
 * config, credentials, or worktree paths.
 *
 * **Busy/current-run is derived from run lifecycle, never client-supplied**:
 * `deriveWorkerRunState` reads the worker's *live* Phase-2 session
 * (`getLiveSessionForWorker`) and, only when that session points at a run that
 * is actually `running` in the `runs` table, reports the worker busy. A stale
 * `current_run_id` left over from a completed/failed run reads as idle.
