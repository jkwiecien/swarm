/**
 * The worker **session lease** — the single source of truth for the shape
 * (ai/CODING_STANDARDS.md "Zod is the source of truth"). Where `Worker`
 * (`./worker.ts`) models *where* a user can execute, a worker session models the
 * one **live claim** on that execution environment: at most one session exists
 * per registered worker, so two `swarm-cli` daemons can never drive the same
 * machine at once (ADR-001 "User / worker"). Phase 2 of the worker slice, on top
 * of Phase 1's identity (`./worker-service.ts`).
 *
 * A session carries a **fencing token** — a per-worker monotonic counter bumped
 * every time the lease is (re-)acquired. It is the standard fencing-token
 * pattern for a lease: a stale holder that was replaced (its expired lease
 * re-acquired by a newer daemon) still remembers the old token, so a later
 * dispatch/advance can reject its writes by comparing tokens
 * (`validateFencingToken`, the seam #130 calls). `lastHeartbeatAt` drives
 * expiry: a session is *live* only while its last heartbeat is within the
 * heartbeat TTL, and an expired session may be re-acquired with a bumped token.
 * `currentRunId` is the run the session is executing, or `null` when idle.
 *
 * This is the persisted-row read model; `src/db/schema/workerSessions.ts` is its
 * table and `src/db/repositories/workerSessionsRepository.ts` owns the atomic
 * acquire/heartbeat/release transitions. The domain-level helpers here
 * (`isSessionLive`, `nextFencingToken`) stay dependency-free so both the
 * repository and the service share one definition of "live" and "next token".
