/**
 * The link between a **SWARM user** and a handle they own on an external
 * provider — the single source of truth for the shape (ai/CODING_STANDARDS.md
 * "Zod is the source of truth"). A `SwarmUser` (`./schema.ts`) is deliberately
 * provider-neutral and knows nothing about GitHub; this is the one place that
 * says "the `jkwiecien` login on `github-projects` is *this* SWARM user".
 *
 * It exists so assignee-driven routing (ADR-001's execution-affinity rule,
 * issue #130) can ask "who is this work item assigned to, in SWARM terms?"
 * without pipeline code ever pattern-matching a GitHub identity shape
 * (ai/RULES.md §2). `provider` is a provider-neutral source key — a `PMType`
 * such as `github-projects` — so the same table serves a future Jira/Linear/SCM
 * provider without a schema change.
 *
 * Links are seeded by an operator (`swarm identities link`); automatic linking
 * (OAuth, SCM account discovery) is a later concern, and ADR-001 open question 5
 * — an unlinked or ambiguous handle — is answered by construction: a
 * `(provider, handle)` pair maps to at most one SWARM user (the table's unique
 * index, `src/db/schema/userIdentities.ts`), and an unlinked handle resolves to
 * nothing rather than to a guess.

 * still match the `ada` a webhook-sourced work item reports — otherwise the link
 * silently fails to resolve and the item looks unassigned. Normalizing on both
 * write and read also makes the unique index case-insensitive, so the same
