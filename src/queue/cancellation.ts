/**
 * User-initiated run cancellation — the durable, cross-process hand-off behind
 * the dashboard's "Terminate" action (issue #166).
 *
 * The dashboard and worker are separate host processes, so the dashboard can't
 * reach into the worker to kill an in-flight agent (and must never trust a PID
 * the browser hands it). Instead it records the intent in Redis, keyed by the
 * immutable SWARM run id, and notifies the worker:
 *
 *   - A **durable set** (`CANCELLATION_SET_KEY`) of run ids a user asked to
 *     terminate. Durable so a cancellation requested while the worker is between
 *     jobs — or restarting — is still honoured when the run is next examined
 *     ({@link isRunCancellationRequested}), rather than lost with a fired-once
 *     notification.
 *   - A **pub/sub notification** (`CANCELLATION_CHANNEL`) so a worker already
 *     running the matching agent aborts it *promptly* instead of only noticing
 *     on the next poll.
 *
 * Keying on the run id (not the task id) is deliberate: a task can be retried
 * into a *new* run, and a cancellation aimed at the old run must never terminate
 * the retry. The worker clears the entry once it has acted on it (and the
 * `retryNow` mutation clears it before re-running), so a re-run of a terminated
 * run starts clean.
 *
 * Own lazy ioredis client per process, mirroring `project-concurrency.ts` — the
 * dashboard publishes, the worker subscribes, both against the one shared Redis.
