/**
 * PM Provider abstraction — the shared, provider-agnostic contract the router,
 * trigger, and dispatch code program against so none of them ever branch on a
 * concrete provider (ai/CODING_STANDARDS.md "Module shape for a provider").
 *
 * Mirrors Cascade's `src/pm/types.ts`, scoped down to SWARM's MVP: Cascade
 * ships Trello/JIRA/Linear and a much wider surface (checklists, attachments,
 * custom fields, PR linking, discovery); SWARM has exactly one PM provider —
 * GitHub Projects (v2) — and the pipeline only needs four operations. The rest
 * are deliberately left out until a second provider or a phase actually needs
 * them; adding them speculatively would be a standards violation
 * (ai/CODING_STANDARDS.md "Comments" / "don't build it speculatively").
 *
 * This file defines *types only* — the adapter that implements it against the
 * GitHub Projects GraphQL API lives under
 * `src/integrations/pm/github-projects/` and is a separate Phase-2 issue.
 *
 * IDs are plain `string` at this interface, on purpose: the contract is
 * provider-agnostic, so it can't name GitHub-specific branded types
 * (`src/pm/ids.ts`). The adapter brands them internally at its boundary
 * (`parseWorkItemId` on the way in, `unwrap` on the way out) — same split
 * Cascade uses, where the shared interface speaks `string` and each adapter
 * narrows to its own branded IDs.
