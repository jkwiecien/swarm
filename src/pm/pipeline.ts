 *
 * Only two of the four pipeline phases (ai/ARCHITECTURE.md "Pipeline phases")
 * are entered by a *board status change*: Planning (item → "Planning") and
 * Implementation (item → "In Progress"). The other two — Review and
 * Respond-to-review — are driven by SCM events (a PR opening / a check suite
 * completing / a review being submitted), not by the PM board, so they have no
 * entry in this map. That asymmetry is intentional: this map is exactly the set
 * of statuses whose transition should fire a PM `status-changed` trigger.
 *
 * Keys are the canonical SWARM pipeline status keys (the same ones the config's
 * `statusOptions` map and `ListWorkItemsFilter.status` use — `src/pm/types.ts`),
 * not a provider's opaque option IDs. Mapping a provider's option ID to one of
 * these keys is the adapter's job (each provider owns that translation).
