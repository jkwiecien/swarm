 * parts that are the same for every provider — the heuristic that finds
 * dependency references in free-text (an item's description/comments) and the
 * human-readable formatting of blockers for comments and deferral messages — so
 * each adapter resolves the same mentions and phrases the same messages without
 * reinventing them (ai/RULES.md §2). The provider-specific half — turning a
 * reference into a live open/closed state — stays inside each adapter.
