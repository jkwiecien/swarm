/**
 * In-process registry of the {@link AbortController} backing each run currently
 * executing in *this* worker, keyed by run id (issue #166). It's the bridge
 * between the cross-process cancellation notification (`src/queue/cancellation.ts`,
 * delivered on the worker's Redis subscriber) and the per-run abort signal
 * threaded into `runPhase`: when a cancellation for a run id arrives, the worker
 * looks the run up here and aborts its controller, which kills the in-flight
 * agent CLI via its existing `AbortSignal` path (SIGTERM→SIGKILL) and lets the
 * phase run its normal worktree/lease cleanup.
 *
 * Single-worker MVP, so an in-memory map suffices; the durable Redis set remains
 * the source of truth for *whether* a run was cancelled (a cancellation that
 * arrives with no controller registered — the worker isn't running that run yet,
 * or already finished it — is a no-op here and is instead caught by the worker's
 * start-check against that set). A multi-worker deployment would route the
 * notification to the owning worker rather than broadcasting.
