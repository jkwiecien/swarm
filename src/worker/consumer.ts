/**
 * The worker's job processor — the Phase-3 wiring: dequeued job → trigger
 * lookup → pipeline phase (ai/ARCHITECTURE.md "Components").
 *
 * A matched trigger names one of the pipeline phases plus its inputs
 * (`src/triggers/types.ts`); this dispatches on that phase and hands off to the
 * phase orchestrator (`src/pipeline/*`), which owns the whole run — worktree
 * provisioning + environment graft (SWARM-14/15), the agent CLI (SWARM-16),
 * reading its hand-off file, posting back to the PM board, and cleanup. The
 * worker's job here is just to resolve the project, build the PM provider the
 * PM-driven phases need, and translate the phase's result (or failure) into a
 * `JobOutcome`.
 *
 * Queue-agnostic on purpose: `processJob` takes an already-validated `SwarmJob`
 * and knows nothing about BullMQ, so tests drive it directly and the entry
 * point (`src/worker/index.ts`) stays a thin shell.

/**
 * The per-phase agent override (`cli`/`model`) a project configured, resolving
 * `runPhase`'s own `project.agents?.<phase>?.{cli,model}` lookup once so a run
 * row can record the *requested* model at creation without threading it through
 * `runPhase`'s signature. `model` may be undefined — "the phase's coded default
 * is in effect", the same convention `describeAgent` uses.
 *
 * `engine` is the resolved effective CLI (`cli` with the coded {@link
 * DEFAULT_ENGINE} applied), persisted on the run row at creation/reset so the
 * dashboard shows it while a run is still `running` (issue #169); `cli` stays
 * undefined-preserving because the phase orchestrators expect that (they apply
 * their own `DEFAULT_*_CLI`). Finalization still records what actually ran
 * (`AgentCliResult.cli`), confirming or correcting the persisted engine.
 *
 * The model is resolved through the same fallback chain `runPhase` uses
 * (per-phase → project default → global default → coded default), so the
 * recorded value matches what actually runs.
 *
 * Which of the phase's `targets` is resolved comes from {@link PhaseResolution}:
 * the federated gate's chosen target when a worker was selected for it (issue
 * #339), else the highest-priority target *this* worker can run (issue #346, see
 * {@link selectTarget}). A per-run override still pins one exact target and is
 * never routed around.

 * failed — the agent exited non-zero, a hand-off file was missing, or worktree
 * setup failed — completes as `phase-failed` rather than throwing: an agent run
 * isn't idempotent, so a BullMQ retry storm is worse than surfacing the failure
 * in the outcome (the phase already logs the agent's own stdout/stderr, and
 * reporting to the PM board is the phase's job). The one thing that still
 * throws is an unknown project — infrastructure the job can't proceed without.
 *
 * The exception to "failed phases don't retry" is a deferrable
 * {@link AgentRunError}: a usage/session-limit hit (classified `rate-limit`,
 * issue #91) or a run the worker itself cancelled (classified `aborted` — the
 * *worker* shutting down while a phase was mid-run, e.g. a dev `--watch`
 * restart, a deploy, or a graceful SIGTERM/SIGINT; confirmed live when
 * unrelated code edits during active development kept restarting the worker
 * mid-review and permanently failing it, since a SIGTERM-killed run doesn't
 * look like a rate limit and there was no other path back to `phase-deferred`).
 * Either way the agent never did any *lasting* work of its own accord, so
 * instead of `phase-failed` this returns `phase-deferred` with a delay, and the
 * worker entrypoint re-enqueues the job once it's safe to retry. Capped at
 * {@link MAX_RATE_LIMIT_RETRIES} so a persistent limit — or a job that reliably
 * crashes the worker — eventually surfaces as a real failure.
 *
 * `signal` is the worker's shutdown signal: aborting kills a running agent CLI
 * (SIGTERM→SIGKILL) so graceful shutdown doesn't hang behind a long run.
