/**
 * Worker-safe projection of a project config (issue #393, ADR-002 §1).
 *
 * A pipeline phase reads project config from the DB while it runs in-process,
 * with the full `ProjectConfig` — including the `credentials` block (references
 * into the encrypted secret store, `src/config/schema.ts`) and provider-specific
 * board/field IDs. A future *remote* worker (ADR-002 split delivery) has no DB
 * access and must never receive server-side secrets.
 *
 * This module is the single enforcement point for that boundary: an **allowlist**
 * projection `toWorkerConfig(project)` that yields only the fields explicitly
 * marked worker-safe. An allowlist (not a blocklist) is deliberate — a field is
 * excluded from the worker payload unless it is named in `WORKER_SAFE_KEYS`, so a
 * future secret-bearing `ProjectConfig` field is excluded *by default* rather than
 * leaking until someone remembers to omit it.
 *
 * The two key sets drive both the Zod projection schema and the drift-guard test
 * (`tests/unit/config/worker-config.test.ts`), so every `ProjectConfig` field must
 * be classified as one or the other and the boundary stays honest as the schema
 * grows.
