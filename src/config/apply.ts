/**
 * Config-file → DB loader (SWARM-56): the piece that turns a validated
 * `swarm.config.json` into the Postgres rows the router and worker actually read
 * from (`src/db/repositories/projectsRepository.ts`). Mirrors the intent of
 * Cascade's `tools/seed-config-from-json.ts`, adapted to SWARM's config shape
 * and credential model. `swarm config apply` / `npm run db:seed` are the two
 * front doors onto this function (`src/cli/commands/config.ts`).
 *
 * Two things are persisted per project:
 *   1. the project row itself (`upsertProjectToDb`), and
 *   2. its credentials — but the config only holds *references* (env-var keys),
 *      never the secrets (`src/config/schema.ts`, `CredentialsSchema`). So for
 *      each unique reference the loader reads `process.env[key]` and stores that
 *      value into `project_credentials`, encrypted at rest with the project id
 *      as AAD (`src/db/crypto.ts`), which is exactly what `resolveProjectCredential`
 *      reads back at runtime.
 *
 * Both writes are upserts keyed on stable ids, so `apply` is idempotent — a
 * re-run after editing the file reconciles rather than duplicating. A reference
 * whose env var is unset is warned-and-skipped rather than fatal: applying the
 * config before every secret is exported is a legitimate partial state, and the
 * skipped reference stays as documentation to be filled in on a later re-run.
