/**
 * The non-secret slice of a `ProjectConfig` — the only view of a project's
 * config a worker may ever see over the transport (`src/transport/protocol.ts`).
 * It is the full config with the `credentials` block removed.
 *
 * Persona secrets are never in `ProjectConfig` to begin with: `CredentialsSchema`
 * (`./schema.ts`) stores only *references* into the secret store, and the
 * resolved token values are fetched per-persona at run time (ai/ARCHITECTURE.md
 * "SCM: GitHub"). Omitting the whole block means the worker never even learns
 * those reference keys — a strictly tighter boundary than stripping secrets that
 * were never present.
 *
 * Derived from `ProjectConfigSchema.omit(...)` rather than a hand-rewritten
 * object so it can never drift from the config schema: a new *non-secret* field
 * is included automatically, and a future *secret* field would have to be added
 * to the `.omit()` list — a deliberate one-line decision at this seam.
