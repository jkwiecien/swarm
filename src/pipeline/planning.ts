/**
 * Planning phase (PROJECT.md §5.1, ai/ARCHITECTURE.md "Pipeline phases" #1).
 *
 * An item moves to "Planning" on the board → the worker runs this: provision a
 * read-only worktree, spin up the planning agent (Antigravity per §5.1, though
 * `DEFAULT_PLANNING_CLI` below currently runs Claude Code instead — see that
 * constant's comment) to explore the code graph and write a step-by-step
 * `proposed_plan.md`, and post that plan as a comment on the linked Issue
 * (GitHub Projects items have no long-form body of their own). Whether the
 * item then moves itself to "ToDo" is a per-project setting
 * (`project.pipeline.planning.autoAdvance`, `src/config/schema.ts`) —
 * defaulting to `false`: a human reviews the plan, then moves the item
 * themselves to greenlight Implementation. The plan is a review artefact, not
 * code — it's delivered as a comment and the worktree is thrown away, so the
 * checkout is detached and never commits.
 *
 * This is the phase's orchestration only. It composes the building blocks that
 * already exist — `GitWorktreeManager` (SWARM-14), `graftEnvironment` (SWARM-15),
 * `runAgentCli` (SWARM-16), the `PMProvider` contract (SWARM-11) — and takes them
 * (plus the work item) as inputs rather than reaching for a queue or a concrete
 * GraphQL provider. The BullMQ consumer that dequeues a `TASK_TYPE_PLANNING` job
 * and calls this, and the concrete GitHub Projects `PMProvider` adapter, are
 * their own issues (SWARM-17/35 and the PM-adapter issue); this lands ahead of
 * them the same way the router's enqueue seam did, wired up when they arrive.

/**
 * Run the Planning phase for one work item. Provisions a detached worktree, runs
 * the planning agent to produce `proposed_plan.md`, and posts it as a comment on
 * the linked Issue. Whether the item then moves to "ToDo" is `autoAdvance`
 * (default `false`) — a human moves it themselves after reviewing the plan
 * unless the project opted into automatic advancement.
 *
 * When `autoSplit` (default `true`) is on and the agent judged the item too large,
 * it also writes `proposed_split.json`: the original item is re-scoped into the
 * smaller first task (`proposed_plan.md` is that task's plan) and the remaining
 * work is spawned as sibling items. Each sibling enters Planning only after its
 * validated preplan marker is written, is tagged with {@link SPLIT_CHILD_LABEL},
 * and gets a comment explaining the split. Its marker suppresses a second Planning
 * agent run; the human then starts implementation by moving it to ToDo in order. The original
 * (first task) still honors `autoAdvance` as usual, unless it is itself a
 * split-child.
 *
 * With `autoSplit` on, the run also enforces a deterministic scope gate (issue
 * #268): the agent must write a validated {@link PROPOSED_SCOPE_FILENAME}, and an
 * unsplit single task declaring more than `maxConcerns` (default `1`) independent
 * concerns fails Planning with an actionable request to narrow or split, rather
 * than auto-advancing an oversized plan to Implementation.
 *
 * Throws if the agent exits non-zero, produces no plan, or fails the scope gate —
 * a planning run that didn't yield a usable, right-sized plan is a failed job,
 * not a soft miss (ai/CODING_STANDARDS.md "Error handling"), and the throw lets
 * the worker mark the job failed. The worktree is always removed, success or
 * failure.

 * Acquire the read-only (detached-HEAD) checkout for the planning run. When

 * so the agent can `--resume` in place; if that worktree is gone (`reuse`

 * reports whether a session worktree was actually reused, so the caller only
 * threads the resume session id through when its checkout is really in place.
