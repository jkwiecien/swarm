/**
 * Respond-to-CI phase (ai/ARCHITECTURE.md "Pipeline phases" — respond-to-ci).
 *
 * A PR's check suite completes with a failure → the worker runs this: provision
 * a worktree on the PR's existing task branch, spin up Claude Code as the
 * implementer to read the failing checks, and fix the build — pushing a fix
 * commit — or, if the failure isn't something a code change should address
 * (flaky/infra), report that it left the code alone. Mirrors Cascade's
 * respond-to-ci agent. Deciding *which* event triggers this (a `check_suite`
 * `completed` whose aggregate state shows a failed check, on a same-repo PR) is
 * the `pr-review` trigger handler's job (`src/triggers/handlers/review.ts`), not
 * this phase's: it receives a build to fix, already vetted, plus the per-PR
 * attempt cap that stops a never-sticking fix from looping.
 *
 * The checkout is the PR branch itself (`provision`'s `createBranch: false`
 * seam) — like Respond-to-review and unlike Review's detached throwaway, the
 * implementer commits and pushes here. That checkout target must already exist
 * as a *local* branch: `git worktree add <path> <branch>` doesn't DWIM
 * remote-only branches, so this phase leans on the Implementation phase having
 * created `issue-<n>` in the same `repoRoot` and its cleanup leaving the branch
 * behind (see `runImplementationPhase`'s re-run note). The local branch can be
 * *stale* — origin moves on the second CI-fix round or when a human co-pushes —
 * so the prompt's first step fast-forwards it; a diverged branch fails that sync
 * (and the job) rather than fixing code the failing CI never ran against.
 *
 * Same token plumbing as Implementation, for the same reason: the implementer
 * persona's token is resolved and handed to the agent as `GH_TOKEN` (mirroring
 * `runReviewPhase`'s reviewer-token plumbing) so every `gh` call — the PR
 * comment included — acts as that persona, not whatever `gh auth` session
 * happens to be ambient on the worker's host. (An earlier version of this
 * comment claimed the ambient credentials already *were* the implementer
 * persona; confirmed live on the Implementation phase that assumption was
 * false — see `runImplementationPhase`'s header.) No PM interaction: the item
 * already sits at "In review", and pushing a fix doesn't change board
 * status — the fresh check suite the fix triggers (→ Review on green, or another
 * CI-fix round on red) is what moves things next.
 *
 * This is the phase's orchestration only, same as the other phases. It composes
 * `GitWorktreeManager` (SWARM-14), `graftEnvironment` (SWARM-15) and
 * `runAgentCli` (SWARM-16), and takes the PR coordinates as inputs rather than
 * reaching for a queue or webhook payload.
