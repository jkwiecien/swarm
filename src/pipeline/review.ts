/**
 * Review phase (PROJECT.md §5.3, ai/ARCHITECTURE.md "Pipeline phases" #3).
 *
 * A PR opens / its check suite passes → the worker runs this: provision a
 * read-only worktree at the PR's head commit, spin up Claude Code as the
 * reviewer persona to read the diff and verify findings against the checkout,
 * and have it submit a formal GitHub PR review — mirroring Cascade's
 * review-agent trigger on `check_suite` success.
 *
 * The review must be a *formal* review (`gh pr review`), not a plain comment:
 * the Respond-to-review phase (SWARM-21) is driven by the
 * `pull_request_review` webhook that only a submitted review emits, and its
 * `changes_requested` state is what routes work back to the implementer
 * (ai/ARCHITECTURE.md "Pipeline phases" #4). That in turn forces the persona
 * plumbing here: GitHub refuses to let a PR's author review their own PR, so
 * the agent's `gh` must authenticate as the *reviewer* persona, not the
 * implementer who opened it. SWARM's harness has no gadget layer (unlike
 * Cascade's `CreatePRReview`), so the reviewer token is resolved from the
 * project's credentials and handed to the CLI process as `GH_TOKEN` — the env
 * var `gh` reads before any ambient login. The token crosses exactly one
 * boundary (resolution → subprocess env), never function layers
 * (ai/CODING_STANDARDS.md "Error handling" / credential scoping).
 *
 * The checkout is detached at the PR's head SHA, like Planning's throwaway
 * checkout: review is read-only, and checking out the PR's `issue-<n>` branch
 * would collide with the local branch the Implementation phase's cleanup
 * leaves behind (see `runImplementationPhase`'s re-run note). The head SHA —
 * which the `pull_request` and `check_suite` webhooks both carry — also pins
 * the review to exactly the commit CI validated.
 *
 * No PM interaction: the item already sits at "In review" (the Implementation
 * phase moved it), and a submitted review doesn't change board status — any
 * verdict drives SWARM-21 (the implementer always responds, even to an
 * approval). Merging is not this phase's job either: after an eligible
 * `approve` the worker persists a durable merge dispatch (issue #292,
 * `src/worker/merge-automation.ts`) executed through the provider-neutral
 * merge capability (`src/scm/merge.ts`), or the PR is left to a human.
 *
 * This is the phase's orchestration only, same as Planning/Implementation. It
 * composes `GitWorktreeManager` (SWARM-14), `graftEnvironment` (SWARM-15) and
 * `runAgentCli` (SWARM-16), and takes the PR coordinates as inputs rather than
 * reaching for a queue or webhook payload. The trigger handler that matches
 * `pull_request` opened / `check_suite` success events and calls this —
 * including the aggregate-check-state and dedup policy Cascade's
 * `check-suite-success` trigger encodes — is its own issue, wired via
 * `src/triggers/builtins.ts` when it lands. That handler must accept only
 * same-repo PRs: `provision`'s best-effort `git fetch origin` fetches branch
 * refs, so a fork PR's head SHA is unreachable here and the detached checkout
 * would fail the job.
