/**
 * Implementation phase (PROJECT.md §5.2, ai/ARCHITECTURE.md "Pipeline phases" #2).
 *
 * An item moves to "ToDo" on the board → the worker runs this: move the item to
 * "In progress" to report that the agent has picked up the task (a status
 * report, not a trigger — see `src/pm/pipeline.ts`; this move is unconditional),
 * provision a worktree on the task branch (not detached — unlike Planning, this
 * phase commits and pushes), graft the environment, spin up Claude Code as the
 * implementer to implement the plan / run tests / commit / push / open a PR,
 * post the PR link back on the item, and move it to "In review" when the Review
 * phase is enabled. Review itself starts from PR lifecycle events, not this
 * Projects status report.
 *
 * Unlike Cascade — whose implementer opens the PR through a `CreatePR` gadget
 * exposed to the agent — SWARM's harness is deliberately narrow (`runAgentCli`
 * only spawns the CLI, no gadget layer; see ai/ARCHITECTURE.md "Harness"). So the
 * agent opens the PR itself via `gh` (the same way the `/solve-issue` skill does)
 * and hands the URL back through a file, mirroring how the Planning phase reads
 * `proposed_plan.md`. The `Closes #<n>` in the PR body is what links the PR back
 * to the Issue the Projects item wraps; the comment this phase posts is the
 * human-facing pointer.
 *
 * The implementer persona's token is resolved and handed to the agent as
 * `GH_TOKEN` (mirroring `runReviewPhase`'s reviewer-token plumbing) so `gh pr
 * create` opens the PR as that persona, not whatever `gh auth` session happens
 * to be ambient on the worker's host. Confirmed live: without this, the PR
 * came back authored by the developer's own account, which the author-persona
 * gate (`ai/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `src/triggers/handlers/review.ts`) correctly
 * refuses to review — "not a SWARM persona" — silently stranding the item in
 * "In review" forever with nothing to trigger Review, let alone
 * Respond-to-review after it.
 *
 * This is the phase's orchestration only. It composes the building blocks that
 * already exist — `GitWorktreeManager` (SWARM-14), `graftEnvironment` (SWARM-15),
 * `runAgentCli` (SWARM-16), the `PMProvider` contract (SWARM-11) — and takes them
 * (plus the work item) as inputs rather than reaching for a queue or a concrete
 * GraphQL provider. The BullMQ consumer that dequeues a `TASK_TYPE_IMPLEMENTATION`
 * job and calls this, and the concrete GitHub Projects `PMProvider` adapter, are
 * their own issues (SWARM-17 and the PM-adapter issue); this lands ahead of them
 * the same way Planning did, wired up when they arrive.
