/**
 * Follow-up Review scheduling — the reliable hand-off from a `fixed`
 * Respond-to-review response to exactly one Review run on the newly pushed
 * commit (issue #241). Injected into `runRespondToReviewPhase`
 * (`src/pipeline/respond-to-review.ts`) the same way `mergeAfterReviewIfEligible`
 * is injected into `runReviewPhase` (`src/pipeline/merge-after-review.ts`): a
 * typed operation with a real GitHub/queue-backed default, overridden in tests.
 *
 * The default builds a synthetic `check_suite`-shaped `GitHubParsedEvent` for
 * the new head SHA and enqueues it exactly like a real webhook
 * (`src/queue/producer.ts`'s `enqueueJob`), so it re-enters the *same*
 * `pr-review` trigger handler (`src/triggers/handlers/review.ts`) a real
 * completed check suite would: the aggregate-check decision (review / respond-
 * to-ci / bounded recheck), the author-persona gate, the PR+SHA dispatch dedup,
 * and the durable two-verdict ledger reservation all apply unchanged — this
 * module only ever constructs the trigger *input*, never touches those
 * decisions itself.
 *
 * The BullMQ job id is a deterministic hash of (project, PR, new head SHA), not
 * a random id — `enqueueJob` treats a job whose id already exists as a no-op
 * (`src/queue/producer.ts`), so a queueing crash-and-retry (this call fails and
 * `runRespondToReviewPhase` reraises it as a `DeliveryDeferredError`, or a
 * worker restart mid-delivery) re-issues the identical id instead of a second
 * job.
