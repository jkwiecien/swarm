 * this is a read-only phase, explicitly *not* to modify code or implement
 * anything (mirroring Cascade's planning agent, which is read/write-to-PM only).
 *
 * The prompt always carries a minimal-scope rule (plan the smallest change that
 * satisfies the item; no speculative generalization — issue #268).
 *
 * When `allowSplit` is on (the project's `pipeline.planning.autoSplit`), the
 * agent is additionally told concrete split criteria and to judge whether the
 * work is too large for a single focused PR and, if so, to split it:
 * `proposed_plan.md` then covers only the first (now-smaller) task, and
 * `proposed_split.json` lists the remaining sibling tasks (see
 * {@link PROPOSED_SPLIT_FILENAME}). A right-sized task is left whole. It is also
 * told to record a scope gate — a "## Scope gate" section in `proposed_plan.md`
 * and a machine-readable {@link PROPOSED_SCOPE_FILENAME} — that SWARM's
 * deterministic post-plan guard validates.
 *
 * `customPrompt` is the project's optional per-phase instructions (issue #135):
 * appended after the SWARM instructions and before the work-item context as a
 * clearly delimited, supplement-only section (empty when unset).
