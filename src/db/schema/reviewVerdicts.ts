/**
 * The durable, restart-safe ledger backing the two-verdict SWARM Review safety
 * cap (issue #235). One logical delivery record per `(project, repository, PR,
 * head SHA)` — a "review slot" — reserved by the `pr-review` trigger
 * (`src/triggers/handlers/review.ts`) before the Review phase runs and marked
 * `submitted` by the phase itself (`src/pipeline/review.ts`) once
 * `ScmDeliveryProvider.submitReview` has returned/recovered a `reviewId`.
 *
 * `ordinal` numbers a PR's review slots (1 = the initial review, 2 = the one
 * permitted re-review); `reviewVerdictsRepository.ts` never creates a third.
 * `state` starts `pending` (reserved, not yet known to have submitted),
 * flips to `submitted` once delivery confirms it, or `abandoned` when the
 * phase knows for certain the review was never submitted (freeing that
 * ordinal for a fresh attempt at the same head without "charging" the PR for
 * the failed retry — the cap counts only `submitted` slots, plus at most one
 * `pending` slot in flight at a time).
 *
 * `repository` denormalizes the owning project's `repo` (rather than joining
 * `projects` for every lookup), matching `runs.prNumber`/`runs.prTitle`'s
 * precedent of carrying PR-driven-phase context directly on the row.
