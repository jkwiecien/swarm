/**
 * One row per **worker session lease** — the persisted form of `WorkerSession`
 * (`src/identity/worker-session.ts`), which stays the source of truth for the
 * shape (ai/CODING_STANDARDS.md "Zod is the source of truth"). Phase 2 of the
 * worker slice: at most one live claim on a registered worker, so two daemons
 * can never drive the same machine at once (ADR-001 "User / worker").
 *
 * `worker_id` is a `workers.id` (`uuid`); the FK is `ON DELETE CASCADE`, so a
 * session vanishes with its worker and never dangles. The **unique index** on
 * `worker_id` is the crux of the invariant: at most one row per worker exists at
 * a time — a second concurrent `acquireLease` for the same worker either loses
 * the row lock (existing row) or trips this constraint (racing insert), so
 * exactly one caller wins (`workerSessionsRepository.ts`). A re-acquire replaces
 * the same row in place rather than inserting a second.
 *
 * `fencing_token` is a per-worker monotonic counter bumped on every re-acquire
 * (`bigint`, mode number — a lease counter, not a hot-path id). `last_heartbeat_at`
 * is the instant expiry is measured from: a session is live only while its last
 * heartbeat is within the heartbeat TTL. `current_run_id` FKs `runs.id` `ON
 * DELETE SET NULL` — the run the session is executing, cleared (not cascaded to
 * the session) when that run row is removed, so losing a run never drops the lease.
