/**
 * One row per registered **worker** — the persisted form of `Worker`
 * (`src/identity/worker.ts`), which stays the source of truth for the shape
 * (ai/CODING_STANDARDS.md "Zod is the source of truth"). The third slice of the
 * multi-user foundation (ADR-001): where `users` models a person and
 * `project_members` a person's role on a project, this models a locally operated
 * execution environment a user owns.
 *
 * `owner_user_id` is a `users.id` (`uuid`); the FK is `ON DELETE CASCADE`, so a
 * worker vanishes with its owner and never dangles. `capabilities` is the
 * declared set of agent CLIs, persisted as `jsonb` of `AgentCli[]` (the Zod
 * `WorkerCapabilitiesSchema` is the source of truth for the values), matching how
 * `runs.usage` persists a typed jsonb value.
 *
 * `credential_hash` is a SHA-256 of the worker credential — **never** the raw
 * token. It is deliberately **not** part of the `Worker` domain read model
 * (`rowToWorker` drops it) and never leaves the DB layer, the same treatment
 * `user_sessions.token_hash` / `users.password_hash` get. It is unique so a
 * credential resolves to at most one worker (the authentication seam).
 *
 * Like the rest of the multi-user foundation this is inert for now: nothing reads
 * it yet — worker sessions (Phase 2) and enrollment/routing (Phase 3, #130) do.
