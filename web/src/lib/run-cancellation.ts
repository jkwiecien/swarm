 * this module normalises the one exact string historical rows persisted before
 * that change, so old rows read the same way without a DB rewrite.
 *
 * Origin display (issue #308) is separate, additive structured data
 * (`describeCancellationOrigin`): it's shown only when a cancellation origin
 * was actually recorded, never inferred from the marker's mere existence.
