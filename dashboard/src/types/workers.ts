 * Mirrors the server worker read models (`src/identity/worker-enrollment-service.ts`).
 * The web package doesn't import server modules, so this re-declares the shapes
 * here the same way `RunRow` (`./runs.ts`) hand-mirrors the runs row — keep them
 * in step with the service's `DashboardWorkerView`, `WorkerRosterEntry`, and
 * `OwnerWorkerView`.
 *
 * Everything here is secret-free by construction on the server: no machine path,
 * credential, token, or credential hash crosses the wire. The one operable field
 * the Workers screen exposes is the owner-controlled `sharingConsent` toggle
 * (#282) — wired to `workers.setConsent`, which enforces ownership server-side;
 * everything else (approval, routing, machine lifecycle) stays read-only.
