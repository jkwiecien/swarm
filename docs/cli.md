# SWARM command reference

Every command SWARM ships, in one place: the **`swarm` operator CLI** (stack
lifecycle, config, users, workers, project membership) and the **`npm run`
scripts** that run the host processes (API, worker, dashboard) and the
database/queue/test tooling.

This document is the human-readable mirror of the CLI's own `--help` output and
the `package.json` scripts — it stays in lock-step with them (see
[`ai/RULES.md` §1/§7](../ai/RULES.md)). For config *options* (env vars,
`swarm.config.json` fields) see [`configuration.md`](./configuration.md); for
operator workflows see [`operations.md`](./operations.md).

---

## Invoking the CLI

The `swarm` CLI is a small operator dispatcher (`src/cli/index.ts`). Two ways to
call it:

```bash
npm run swarm -- <command> [options]   # from source (loads .env if present)
swarm <command> [options]              # global binary, after `npm run build`
```

`npm run swarm -- …` runs it straight from TypeScript via `tsx`, loading `.env`
when present. The `--` separates npm's own args from the ones passed to the CLI —
it is required.

**Environment.** Commands that touch the database (`config`, `users`, `members`,
`identities`, `workers`, `queue`, `worktrees`) need `DATABASE_URL` (and some also
`REDIS_URL`) in the environment. `npm run swarm -- …` and the dedicated npm
wrappers (`db:seed`, `queue:clear`, `worktrees:prune`) load `.env` for you;
invoking the global `swarm` binary directly requires those vars to be exported.

Run `swarm --help`, or `swarm <command> --help` on the multi-subcommand commands
(`config`, `queue`, `users`, `members`, `identities`, `workers`), to print the
authoritative usage.

| [`config apply`](#swarm-config) | Load `swarm.config.json` into Postgres (projects + credentials) |
| [`start`](#swarm-start) | Start the local stack (postgres, redis, router) |

| [`status`](#swarm-status) | Show container states and probe the router's health |
| [`logs`](#swarm-logs) | Tail stack logs |
| [`queue clear`](#swarm-queue) | Cancel all pending queue work |
| [`users`](#swarm-users) | Manage SWARM users and the installation admin |
| [`members`](#swarm-members) | Manage project membership |
| [`identities`](#swarm-identities) | Link a user to the handles they own on a provider |
| [`workers`](#swarm-workers) | Register and manage local workers |
| [`worktrees prune`](#swarm-worktrees) | Prune stale per-task worktrees |

> The worker is **not** managed by this CLI — it runs on the host, outside Docker
> Compose (it needs the developer's PATH/auth for git and the agent CLIs). Start
> it with `npm run dev:worker` (see [Process & dev scripts](#process--dev-scripts-npm-run)).

### `swarm init`

```bash
swarm init
```

Bootstrap the two pieces of local config a developer needs before starting the
stack: `.env` (copied from `.env.docker.example`) and `swarm.config.json` (the
project config). Both are created **only when absent** — `init` never clobbers an
edited config; if `swarm.config.json` already exists it is validated instead, so
a re-run is a cheap "is my config still well-formed?" check.

### `swarm config`

```bash
swarm config apply [--config <path>]
```

- **`apply`** — upsert the config's projects and referenced credentials into the
  DB. Credential *values* are read from the environment by the reference (env-var
  key) named in each project's `credentials` block; a reference whose env var is
  unset is skipped with a warning, not written.
- **`--config <path>`** — path to the config file (default:
  `<repo-root>/swarm.config.json`).

Wrapper: `npm run db:seed`.

### `swarm start`

```bash
swarm start [--build]
```

Bring up the local stack (postgres, redis, router) via Docker Compose. `--build`
rebuilds images first. The worker is intentionally not started (it runs on the
host).

### `swarm stop`

```bash
swarm stop [-v | --volumes]
```

Tear down the stack. By default the postgres/redis volumes are **preserved** (so
project config and run history survive a restart); `--volumes`/`-v` drops them
for a clean slate.

### `swarm status`

```bash
swarm status
```

A quick health snapshot: the stack's container states (`docker compose ps`) plus
a probe of the router's `/health` endpoint on the published host port
(`ROUTER_PORT`, default 3100). The worker isn't shown (it runs on the host).

### `swarm logs`

```bash
swarm logs [service] [-f | --follow]
```

Tail the stack's container logs. An optional service name (`postgres`, `redis`,
`router`) scopes it to one container; `--follow`/`-f` streams new lines until
interrupted.

### `swarm queue`

```bash
swarm queue clear
```

- **`clear`** — cancel every waiting dispatch (pending, capacity-blocked, and
  retry-scheduled — the canonical durable queue) and drain their queued wake-ups
  plus any legacy Redis jobs. Cancelled dispatches can never be resurrected by a
  retry, slot release, or reconciliation. **Active (running) work is not touched**
  — stop the worker first if nothing should start while clearing.

Requires `DATABASE_URL` and `REDIS_URL`. Wrapper: `npm run queue:clear`.

### `swarm users`

```bash
swarm users add <identifier> [--name <displayName>] [--admin]
swarm users list
swarm users grant-admin <identifier>
swarm users revoke-admin <identifier>
swarm users set-password <identifier>
```

- **`add`** — create a user with the given login handle (username/email).
  `--name` sets the display name (defaults to the identifier); `--admin`
  designates the user an installation admin.
- **`list`** — list all users, one per line.
- **`grant-admin` / `revoke-admin`** — add/remove a user's installation-admin role.
- **`set-password`** — set a user's dashboard login password. Prompts (no echo)
  on a TTY, otherwise reads the password from stdin. Never logs it.

Requires `DATABASE_URL`. Creating the first admin + password is how you get a
dashboard login (there is no self-signup in the UI).

### `swarm members`

```bash
swarm members add <project-id> <user-identifier> [--role <role>]
swarm members list <project-id>
swarm members set-role <project-id> <user-identifier> --role <role>
swarm members remove <project-id> <user-identifier>
```

Manage who belongs to a project and in what role. `--role` is one of
`projectAdmin | member | contributor` (default: `member`). Roles, most to least
privileged: **projectAdmin** (administer) > **member** (write) > **contributor**
(read). Requires `DATABASE_URL`. Membership is the read model authorization will
build on — it is not yet enforced by any router.

### `swarm identities`

```bash
swarm identities link --user <identifier> --provider <provider> --handle <handle>
swarm identities unlink --provider <provider> --handle <handle>
swarm identities list [--user <identifier>]
```

Link a SWARM user to the handles they own on a provider (e.g. a GitHub login), so
assignee resolution can map an inbound event's actor to a SWARM user. `<provider>`
is a provider-neutral source key — `github-projects` for the GitHub Projects
board. Provider and handle are matched case-insensitively. Re-linking the same
pair is a no-op; a handle already linked to a different user is rejected. Requires
`DATABASE_URL`.

### `swarm workers`

```bash
swarm workers register <owner-identifier> --name <displayName> --cli <c1,c2,...>
swarm workers list [<owner-identifier>]
swarm workers set-cli <worker-id> --cli <c1,c2,...>
swarm workers remove <worker-id>
swarm workers enroll <worker-id> <project-id> --cli <c1,c2,...> [--concurrency <n>] [--active] [--consent]
swarm workers approve <worker-id> <project-id>
swarm workers consent <worker-id> <project-id> <on|off>
```

- **`register`** — register a worker for an owner (by login handle) with a display
  name and declared CLIs (`--cli`, comma-separated, one or more of
  `claude | antigravity | codex`). **Prints a worker credential ONCE** — store it
  then (it is never shown again) and put it in `.env` as `SWARM_WORKER_CREDENTIAL`;
  the host worker authenticates its session with it at startup.
- **`list`** — list workers (`<id>\t<displayName>\t<clis>` per line). With an owner
  identifier, only that owner's; without, all owners'. Never prints a credential.
- **`set-cli`** — replace a worker's declared CLIs by worker id.
- **`remove`** — deregister a worker by worker id.
- **`enroll`** — enroll a worker into a project with allowed CLIs (`--cli`, a
  subset of the worker's capabilities) and an optional `--concurrency` (default 1).
  Starts pending with sharing consent off; `--active` approves it and `--consent`
  grants sharing consent at once (operator seeding).
- **`approve`** — approve a pending enrollment (worker + project) → active.
- **`consent`** — turn an enrollment's owner-controlled sharing consent on or off.
  Revoking it blocks future dispatch without stopping a running agent.

Requires `DATABASE_URL`. A worker is a local execution environment owned by a
SWARM user; an enrollment offers it to a project, and it is routable **only while
active AND sharing consent is on**. A project with no enrolled workers is
unfederated and runs locally.

> **Known gap:** there is no CLI command to change an *existing* enrollment's
> allowed CLIs — `enroll` refuses when the worker is already enrolled. Until one
> is added, widen it with a direct `UPDATE` on `worker_project_enrollments.allowed_clis`.

### `swarm worktrees`

```bash
swarm worktrees prune [--project <id>] [--dry-run]
```

- **`prune`** — sweep and remove stale per-task worktrees under
  `.swarm-workspaces/`. A worktree is only removed when it is safe to discard: not
  leased (in-flight), not pinned by a resumable deferred/failed run, with no
  uncommitted changes **and** no unpushed local commits — anything else is
  reported as skipped and left in place. `--project <id>` limits the sweep to one
  project (default: all configured projects); `--dry-run` reports what would be
  pruned without removing anything.

Requires `DATABASE_URL` (project config) and `REDIS_URL` (in-flight check).
Wrapper: `npm run worktrees:prune`.

## Process & dev scripts (`npm run`)

The host processes and tooling that live outside the `swarm` CLI. Run from the
repo root.

### Services

| Script | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev:api` | Migrate the DB, free `API_PORT`, then start the API server (`:3101`) with `--watch`. In dev it serves the API only; it also serves the built dashboard SPA from `dashboard/dist` when that exists. |
| `npm run start:api` | Build the dashboard, then run `dev:api` — the recommended **same-origin** mode where one process serves the SPA + API on `:3101` (used for public/tunnel access). |
| `npm run reload` | After `git pull`: sync both dependency trees, rebuild the dashboard (`dist`, picked up live by a running `dev:api`/`start:api` since it serves `dist` from disk), and apply migrations. Does **not** restart the worker or rebuild the router — do those manually if their code changed (it prints the reminder). |
| `npm run dev:worker` | Migrate the DB, then start the host worker (BullMQ consumer). This is how the worker runs — it is not in Docker Compose. |
| `npm run dev:worker:watch` | Same as `dev:worker`, with `--watch` auto-restart. |
| `npm run dev:worker:seed` | Apply `swarm.config.json` (`db:seed`) then start the worker. |
| `npm run dev:dashboard` | Start the dashboard Vite dev server (`:5173`) — local development only; not what you expose publicly. |
| `npm run dev:router` | Free `ROUTER_PORT`, then run the router (webhook receiver) on the host with `--watch` — for router development (in normal operation the router runs in Compose). |
| `npm run dev` | Run `src/index.ts` (combined entry) with `--watch`. |

### Build & production start

| Script | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run build` | Compile TypeScript (`tsc`) and rewrite path aliases (`tsc-alias`) into `dist/`. |
| `npm run build:dashboard` | Build the dashboard SPA into `dashboard/dist`. |
| `npm run start` | Run the compiled combined entry (`dist/index.js`). |
| `npm run start:worker` | Migrate the DB, then run the compiled worker (`dist/worker/index.js`). |
| `npm run worker` | `build` then `start:worker`. |

### Database

| Script | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run db:migrate` | Apply pending Drizzle migrations (`drizzle-kit migrate`). |
| `npm run db:seed` | `swarm config apply` — load `swarm.config.json` into Postgres. |
| `npm run db:generate` | Generate a new migration from schema changes (`drizzle-kit generate`). |
| `npm run db:push` | Push the schema directly to the DB without a migration file (`drizzle-kit push`) — dev only. |
| `npm run db:studio` | Open Drizzle Studio against the DB. |

### Queue & worktrees

| Script | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run queue:clear` | `swarm queue clear` with `.env` loaded — cancel all pending queue work. |
| `npm run worktrees:prune` | `swarm worktrees prune` with `.env` loaded — prune stale worktrees. |

### Verification

| Script | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run verify` | `lint` + `typecheck` + `test` — the full pre-merge gate. |
| `npm test` | Unit tests (Vitest) + dashboard tests. |
| `npm run test:unit` | Unit-project tests only. |
| `npm run test:integration` | Integration-project tests (need the test DB — see below). |
| `npm run test:all` | Every Vitest project. |
| `npm run test:watch` | Unit tests in watch mode. |
| `npm run test:coverage` | Unit tests with coverage. |
| `npm run test:dashboard` | Dashboard tests. |
| `npm run test:db:up` / `test:db:down` | Start / tear down the integration-test Postgres (`docker-compose.test.yml`). |
| `npm run lint` / `lint:fix` | Biome check (write mode fixes in place). |
| `npm run typecheck` | Type-check the backend (`tsconfig.typecheck.json`). |
| `npm run typecheck:dashboard` | Type-check the dashboard. |
